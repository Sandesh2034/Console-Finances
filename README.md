# Console Finances 

## Hello, I'm Sandesh Gurung! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Console Finances GitHub repository. This challenge is an exciting opportunity to apply the JavaScript skills I've acquired in a real-world scenario, analyzing financial records of a company. Let's dive into the details!

## Overview

In this challenge, I'll leverage my newfound JavaScript expertise to complete the required activity. The task involves creating code to analyze a financial dataset provided in the `starter/index.js` file. The goal is to calculate essential financial metrics, including total months, net total Profit/Losses, average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease in Profit/Losses over a specific period.

### Deployment

The Console Finances is deployed on GitHub Pages. To explore it, follow the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/Sandesh2034/Console-Finances.git). 

## Instructions

### Setting up the Project

1. **Create GitHub Repo:**
   - I've initiated a GitHub repository named `Console-Finances`.
   - Cloned it to my local machine.

2. **Copy Starter Files:**
   - The starter files from the challenge are copied into my local git repository.

### Analyzing Financial Data

3. **JavaScript Code:**
   - Using JavaScript, I'll analyze the financial records to calculate:
     - Total number of months in the dataset.
     - Net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
     - Average changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
     - Greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
     - Greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

### Viewing Results

4. **Console Output:**
   - When the code is run in the browser, the analysis will be displayed in the console.

### Sample Output:
